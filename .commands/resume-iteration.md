# /resume-iteration

Let me check what iterations are available to resume.

First, I'll look for iterations in the /collabiterations/ directory and check their status.

Based on the RESUME_ITERATION_WORKFLOW.md, I need to:
1. Check /collabiterations/ for available iterations
2. Read each iteration's plan and status
3. Present options to you
4. Load the selected iteration's context

Let me start by checking what's available.
